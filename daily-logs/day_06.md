📅 Day 6 Log – GitHub Daily Journey
🗓️ Date: 29 April 2025
🧠 Focus Area: CTF Practice & Vulnerability Assessment
💻 Machine: Mr. Robot: 1 (VulnHub)

🧪 Activities Performed
🎯 Target Selection: Chose Mr. Robot: 1 from VulnHub for hands-on penetration testing.

🔎 Reconnaissance:

Used netdiscover to identify live hosts on the local network.

Conducted a detailed port scan using nmap to find open ports and running services.

🌐 Enumeration:

Explored web server and extracted clues from the robots.txt and hidden pages.

Utilized dirb and DirBuster for brute-force directory enumeration.

🔓 Exploitation:

Identified and exploited a WordPress vulnerability to gain a reverse shell.

Gained access to the system as a limited user.

📈 Privilege Escalation:

Searched for local exploits and misconfigurations.

Successfully escalated to root and captured all three key flags.

CTF Reporting and Documentation

📝 Reflection
This was a great hands-on experience simulating real-world exploitation. The Mr. Robot CTF gave practical exposure to multiple phases of a penetration test — from initial scanning to full system compromise. These exercises help reinforce vulnerability identification and reporting skills essential for real-world bug hunting and ethical hacking.
