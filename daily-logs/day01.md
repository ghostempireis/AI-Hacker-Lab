# 📅 Daily Log – Day 01 (09 July 2025)

---

## ✅ What I Learned Today:
- Difference between **HTTP and HTTPS** and how they impact security
- Understood **HTTP request and response structure**
- Set up **DVWA locally** and resolved localhost proxy issues
- Used **Burp Suite** to intercept live login requests from DVWA
- Wrote a **Python script** to classify HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Created an **AI-powered prompt** to analyze intercepted HTTP traffic
- Took a **10-question cybersecurity quiz** to test understanding

---

## 🧠 Challenges Faced:
- **Burp Suite was not intercepting localhost** — fixed by editing Firefox’s `about:config`
- Confused between HTTP status codes 401 vs 403 (now crystal clear)
- Forgot the difference between Content-Type and Accept headers (now revised)

---

## 🌟 Favorite Moments:
- Intercepted my first real HTTP request in Burp successfully!
- Discovered that I had already reported and validated a **clickjacking bug** on Bugcrowd
- Realized how **AI can be used to understand and classify traffic**

---

## 🚀 Plan for Tomorrow (Day 2):
- Resume **Block 7**: Write Clickjacking bug report professionally
- Try new DVWA modules (XSS, SQLi, File Upload)
- Create 1 more Python or AI tool to push into `scripts/`
- Improve my understanding of headers and responses in more depth

---

## ⏱ Time Spent:
**Full 8 hours of learning completed**
- 3 study blocks
- 1 AI task
- 1 quiz block
- GitHub pushed + daily logs + screenshots uploaded
